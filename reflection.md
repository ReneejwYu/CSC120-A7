- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Overloading in Library:
addTitle: If we want to add multiple books to library selection at the same time, it is an easier method (method with higher efficiency).
checkOut: If someone want to check out multiple books from library from the same time, it is an easier method (method with higher efficiency).


Overloading in House:
moveIn: Overloading lets moveIn accept a single resident name or a list of residents, enabling both individual and group moves.
moveOut: Overloading allows moveOut to remove a resident by name or by index, making it easier to manage large resident lists.

Overloading in Cafe:
sellCoffee: Overloading sellCoffee with a version that has default ingredient quantities streamlines common orders without requiring full customization each time.
restock:Overloading allows restock to refill specific ingredients individually (like only cups), which is more efficient for targeted inventory management.

I finished this assignment very early this time, which gave me time to ask tutors for help on Sunday and allowed me more time to correct errors and polish my code.
